# AI Prose-Pattern Detector

AI Prose-Pattern Detector is an agent-readable prose QA toolkit for finding
writing patterns that make text sound generic, over-processed, or AI-shaped.

It does not claim to prove who wrote a draft. Instead, it gives writers a
practical review system for visible AI-likeness and prose-quality patterns:
filler openings, lifeless verbs, decorative adjectives, formulaic contrast,
condensed expert prose, mechanical rhythm, generic closers, and formatting that
looks more organized than the thinking underneath it.

## What It Does

- Runs quick flag checks on pasted prose.
- Produces detailed audits with exact excerpts and rewrite suggestions.
- Rewrites text while preserving the user's facts, claims, and domain detail.
- Helps agents produce prose that sounds clear, specific, and human without
  becoming casual or vague.
- Centralizes customization in one settings file.

## Why It Exists

AI-assisted writing often fails in two opposite ways. Some drafts become generic
and padded. Others become compressed expert prose: long noun chains,
comma-packed capability catalogs, and scope-setting phrases that sound sharp
once but robotic after repeated use.

AI Prose-Pattern Detector treats both as quality problems. The goal is not to
make every piece sound informal. The goal is to preserve judgment, specificity,
and voice.

```

## Quick Start

Use the folder as an agent project or copy its contents into a supported AI
workspace.

1. Put `AGENTS.md`, `detector-settings.md`, and `references/` in the project.
2. Paste prose into the agent chat.
3. Ask for one of the supported modes:
   - `/ai-prose-check`
   - `/prose-pattern`
   - `flag check`
   - `audit this`
   - `rewrite using the detector`
   - `produce this in a natural voice`

Examples are optional. They show the intended output style but are not required
for normal use.

## Modes

Flag Check:
Returns risk level, flag count, categories fired, exact excerpts, and one
priority fix.

Audit:
Ranks findings by severity and gives suggested rewrites for each issue.

Rewrite:
Returns revised prose first, preserving meaning and factual claims.

Produce:
Uses the rubric silently while drafting new prose.

## Customization

All behavior settings live in `detector-settings.md`:

- default mode
- rewrite strength
- protected content
- condensed prose thresholds
- contrast phrase policy
- output preferences
- severity scale

The rubric file defines the pattern library. The agent guide tells the agent
when to load which files.

## Example Use

```text
/ai-prose-check

This is not just a reporting process, it is a comprehensive operating cadence
that leverages stakeholder alignment, governance, prioritization, visibility,
decision quality, and execution discipline to drive meaningful outcomes.
```

The detector should flag formulaic contrast, vague verbs, decorative
abstraction, and compressed comma-heavy prose. A better rewrite would name the
practical function of the process and split the crowded sentence.

## Responsible Use

AI Prose-Pattern Detector should not be used to accuse a writer of using AI.
Many flagged patterns also appear in human business writing, especially rushed
executive drafts, consulting prose, and technical documentation.

Use it as a writing quality gate: identify weak patterns, preserve the real
thinking, and improve the draft.
